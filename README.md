## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

In the future I would like to experiment with more animations when hovering. I hope to be able to add more of this interactivity!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Buttons With Awesome Hover Animation Using HTML & CSS by DarkCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgl_etzlTI) - This helped me figure out the animation I used. I really liked figuring out how to get it to work for me.
